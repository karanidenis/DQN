# Creating a Custom Environment for an AC Control System using RL
1. Define Actions and Rewards
Actions: The AC can perform two actions:

0: Cool down the room
1: Warm up the room
Rewards: The reward system can be based on how close the room temperature is to the desired temperature:

Positive reward if the temperature is close to the desired temperature.
Negative reward if the temperature is far from the desired temperature.
